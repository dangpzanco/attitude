# MATLAB: Attitude Dynamics & Control Functions

*These functions originate from the authors of the book Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems (2nd Edition). 
They have since been added to and modified.*

**Original Authors:** Hanspeter Schaub, John L. Junkins

**Expanded & Improved by:** Kevin Dinkel, Zach Dischner


**Description:** These set of MATLAB utility functions can be used to do basic transformations between various attitude representations,
including: Euler Angles (EulerXYZ), Direction Cosine Matrices (C), Principle Rotation Vectors (PRV), Classical Rodrigues Parameters (Gibbs), and 
Modified Rodrigues Parameters (MRP). Also included are useful functions for calculation attitude dynamics and kinematics.
